Welcome to the MI Core. You have come to the right place if:

-   :white_check_mark: You want to develop industrial AI solutions more efficiently and with higher quality
-   :white_check_mark: You want to get a head start on how to use the Siemens inner-source infrastructure for industrial AI development
-   :white_check_mark: You want to share your experiences in the development of industrial AI solutions and learn from others
-   :white_check_mark: You like the idea and concepts of open source software and want to contribute

## Background

The MI Core took its beginning from the machine intelligence program where the task was to
derive reusable assets from specific use cases. Examples are the AI-powered
detection of print errors in additive manufacturing or a vision system for
autonomous trams. Over the course of these projects we improved our
software development capabilities, but also learned how to set up large-scale production
pipelines to train, evaluate and serve machine learning models - on-premise and
in the cloud. We developed tools like SALT for time series annotation, the
ai.store to share models, training blue prints, and many more things that we
have now consolidated as the MI Core framework and you will find the gathered
information on this page.

### Design principles

With the MI Core we follow of popular open source frameworks like Keras or tensorflow and adapt it for our internal needs:

-   **Easy to learn, hard to master.** Every asset should be quickly understandable to support a quick adoption. However it should also be very flexible to allow usage in the (mostly) challenging and specific use cases we are facing in our industries.
-   **A strong community is crucial.** - Without the support of a broad developer community we will not be able to keep up with the pace of external competitors like hyperscalers or open source projects.
-   **High quality documentation is key.** Even the best developer or data scientist does not have the time to understand undocumented code and software for hours or days.
-   **If Siemens knew what Siemens knows.** - If you do not know that others have solved the task that you are currently working on already, you cannot learn from their experience. Let's try (again) to gather this knowledge and make it accessible.
