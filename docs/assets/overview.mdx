In this section, you will find extensive documentation for selected assets that
already have some maturity and/or larger userbase and/or higher quality level.
While all inner sourced assets in the [assetbase](/assetbase) will have at least
a Readme.md providing you with the necessary information to get started, the
[markdown features](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features) of
docusaurus allow to write more thorough explanations and go into more detail,
while keeping a good and readable structure. Also, documentation of different
assets that is structured the same will make it easier for interested users to
grasp the most important information.

## Add an asset

If you would like to use this page to add documentation for your own asset,
please refer to the [contributing section](/docs/contributing#add-an-asset)
