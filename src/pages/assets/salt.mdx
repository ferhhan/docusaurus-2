## Introduction

SALT is intended to be a generalizable tool for anomaly labeling of sensor data. The labeled
data can then be used to train artificial intelligence methods for preventive maintenance. It shall
cover two concrete application scenarios, labeling sensor data of oil pumps and sensor data of
gas turbines. Oil pumps are usually grouped within a hierarchical structure usually representing
physical locations. Gas turbines can as well be organized within a hierarchical structure following
logical groupings. Both pumps and turbines are equipped with different sensors.

## Installation
